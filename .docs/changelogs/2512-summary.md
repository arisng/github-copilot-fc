# Monthly Changelog: December 2025

> **Coverage:** Weeks 49-50 (December 2-14, 2025)
> **Generated:** December 14, 2025

## Executive Summary

December 2025 marks a major milestone with the launch of **Copilot FC**—a unified workspace inspired by the collaborative spirit of a professional football club (FC). Just as a football club brings together specialized players, coaches, and staff working in harmony toward shared victories, Copilot FC orchestrates AI assistants, skills, and tools as a cohesive team to achieve coding excellence. This month focused on establishing a production-ready foundation with automated workflows, clean architecture, and professional tooling that enables seamless collaboration between different AI components, much like how football players pass, defend, and score together.

The project consolidates GitHub Copilot agents and Claude skills into one portable, version-controlled workspace, enabling development teams to share and maintain AI capabilities effectively while fostering the team-sport mentality where every component contributes to collective success.
