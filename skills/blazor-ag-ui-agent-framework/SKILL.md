# AG-UI Blazor + Agent Framework (MAF)

**Version 2.0** - Enhanced with 2026 Agentic UX patterns: Dual-Pane Architecture, Chain of Thought observability, HITL governance workflows, and mobile adaptation strategies.

## Quick Start

For a basic ASP.NET Core agent with Blazor frontend:

1. Install NuGet package: `Microsoft.Agents.AI.Hosting.AGUI.AspNetCore`
2. Create an `AIAgent` using `IChatClient` (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, Ollama)
3. Map the AG-UI endpoint: `app.MapAGUI("/api/chat", agent)` in ASP.NET Core startup
4. In Blazor: Connect via HTTP POST + Server-Sent Events (SSE)
5. Parse AG-UI protocol events; render messages and tool UIs dynamically

**Architectural Foundation - Dual-Pane Pattern:**
- Implement **Context Pane** (chat/negotiation) + **Canvas Pane** (artifact/work product) separation
- This is the 2026 standard for agentic interfaces - enables co-creation workflows
- See [blazor-dual-pane-implementation.md](references/blazor-dual-pane-implementation.md) for component structure

**Triggering Generative UI**: Use intent keywords in prompts:
- "Make an interactive..." (highest success rate)
- "Create an interactive..."
- "Simulate... with adjustable..."
- Keep interfaces focused: specify 2-4 controls per prompt for cleaner layouts

For approval workflows, observability, or shared state, see full workflow below.

## Generative UI patterns (2026): pick the right level of freedom

Generative UI (GenUI) is when the agent influences the interface at runtime (structured inputs, progress UI, dynamic panels), not just text. This is a key shift from the "Conversational Era" (2023-2024) to the "Agentic Era" (2025-2026+), where interfaces must support autonomous, multi-step workflows rather than simple Q&A.

AG-UI is the **runtime event/state protocol** that enables GenUI; it is not a UI specification.

**The GenUI Spectrum** (from most controlled to most flexible):

1. **Static GenUI (AG-UI-style)** — Prebuilt UI components; the agent decides *when* to show them and *what data* they receive.
   - **Best for**: Enterprise apps, high-risk workflows, customer support
   - **Pros**: High polish, perfect brand consistency, zero security risk
   - **Cons**: Limited vocabulary - can't generate novel UIs

2. **Declarative GenUI (A2UI / Adaptive Cards)** — The agent returns a constrained UI description (JSON); the app renders it with validation/whitelisting.
   - **Best for**: General-purpose assistants, business process automation, "Canvas" apps
   - **Pros**: High flexibility, secure (no arbitrary code), framework-agnostic
   - **Cons**: Generic appearance; requires schema validation
   - **⭐ Recommended for baseline implementation** (balances flexibility with safety)

3. **Open-ended GenUI (MCP Apps / Claude Artifacts)** — The agent generates raw HTML/CSS/JS or executes code in a sandbox.
   - **Best for**: Prototyping tools, data visualization explorers, coding assistants
   - **Pros**: Infinite flexibility; can build novel interfaces
   - **Cons**: High security risk (XSS, data exfiltration), performance overhead
   - **⚠️ Use only in sandboxed "Playground" modes**

This skill primarily focuses on **Static GenUI in Blazor** (tool lifecycle → Blazor components), while pointing to safe extension paths for declarative/open-ended approaches.

## The 7 AG-UI Protocol Features & Agent Framework Support

Agent Framework's AG-UI integration supports all 7 standardized protocol features:

1. **Agentic Chat** — Streaming chat with automatic tool calling (no manual parsing)
2. **Backend Tool Rendering** — Tools execute server-side via `AIFunctionFactory`; results stream to client
3. **Human-in-the-Loop** — `ApprovalRequiredAIFunction` middleware converts to approval protocol events
4. **Agentic Generative UI** — Async tools with progress updates for long-running operations
5. **Tool-Based UI Rendering** — Custom Blazor components render based on tool definitions
6. **Shared State** — Bidirectional state synchronization between agent and Blazor client
7. **Predictive State Updates** — Stream tool arguments as optimistic updates before execution

Each feature maps directly to Agent Framework abstractions: `AIAgent`, `IChatClient`, `AIFunctionFactory`, `ApprovalRequiredAIFunction`, `ConversationId`, and tool metadata serialization.

## Full Workflow

1. **Install AG-UI hosting package**
   - `dotnet add package Microsoft.Agents.AI.Hosting.AGUI.AspNetCore`
   - Includes all dependencies: Agent Framework, Extensions.AI, protocol implementation

2. **Create an AIAgent** from IChatClient
   - Wire a chat client (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, Ollama, etc.)
   - Add tools using `AIFunctionFactory.Create()`
   - Optional: wrap with middleware for approvals or state management
   - See [mslearn-ag-ui-getting-started.md](references/mslearn-ag-ui-getting-started.md)

3. **Map the AG-UI endpoint** in ASP.NET Core
   - Use `app.MapAGUI("/api/chat", agent)` to expose agent as HTTP endpoint
   - Handles HTTP POST requests + Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming automatically
   - Manages ConversationId for session context

4. **Implement Dual-Pane Architecture** (core UX pattern)
   - Build **Context Pane** (left/sidebar): chat, approvals, memory inspector
   - Build **Canvas Pane** (right/main): artifact viewer/editor with versioning
   - Implement **Contextual Scoping**: highlight-to-prompt for spatial referencing
   - Enable **State Synchronization**: JSON Patch over SSE for delta updates
   - See [blazor-dual-pane-implementation.md](references/blazor-dual-pane-implementation.md) for complete implementation

5. **Add Observability** (build trust via transparency)
   - Implement **Accordion of Thought**: collapsible reasoning steps (reduces anxiety by 34%)
   - Show **Chain of Thought**: expose agent's reasoning process progressively
   - Build **Memory Inspector**: visualize active facts, context utilization, tool availability
   - Display **Tool Execution**: show what the agent is doing in real-time
   - See [blazor-observability-patterns.md](references/blazor-observability-patterns.md) for component patterns

6. **Implement Human-in-the-Loop workflows** (governance & control)
   - Use **Approval Queue**: non-blocking, inline approval cards (not modals)
   - Implement **Reversibility**: checkpoint system with time-travel UI
   - Add **Diff Previews**: show before/after for code/document changes
   - Create **Panic Button**: emergency stop that halts + reverts state
   - Risk-based escalation: high-risk actions require confirmation, low-risk proceed autonomously
   - See [blazor-hitl-patterns.md](references/blazor-hitl-patterns.md) for HITL patterns
   - Wrap sensitive functions with `ApprovalRequiredAIFunction` on server-side

7. **Implement backend tools**
   - Define tools that execute server-side: search, database queries, API calls
   - Results stream to client via AG-UI protocol
   - See [mslearn-backend-tool-rendering.md](references/mslearn-backend-tool-rendering.md)

8. **Build frontend UI in Blazor**
   - Connect to HTTP endpoint + SSE stream via `HttpClient` and event parsing
   - Implement Blazor components that parse AG-UI protocol events
   - Display chat messages, tool calls, approval requests, and progress updates
   - Handle SSE streaming: append-only event stream, throttle for performance
   - **Validation**: Sanitize HTML, validate JSON structure before rendering
   - **Error handling**: Display partial results on stream failure; provide clear error messages
   - See [blazor-ag-ui-genui-patterns.md](references/blazor-ag-ui-genui-patterns.md) for component patterns
   - Reference: [copilotkit-generative-ui.md](references/copilotkit-generative-ui.md) for UX/GenUI design patterns (framework-agnostic)

9. **Implement generative UI in Blazor** (optional)
   - Use async tools for long-running operations with progress callbacks
   - Render custom Blazor components based on tool definitions (slots, templates)
   - Implement shared state synchronization: parse state events, update Blazor component state bidirectionally
   - Use predictive updates: render tool arguments optimistically before confirmation
   - See [blazor-ag-ui-genui-patterns.md](references/blazor-ag-ui-genui-patterns.md) for Blazor-specific implementation

10. **Extend beyond static GenUI** (optional)
    - **Declarative GenUI**: add a validated, schema-versioned renderer for a constrained UI spec (e.g., cards/forms/tables)
    - **Open-ended GenUI**: embed external UI surfaces only with strict origin allowlists and server-side authorization
    - See [generative-ui-2026-patterns.md](references/generative-ui-2026-patterns.md) for selection guidance and mappings

11. **Mobile adaptation** (if building responsive/mobile apps)
    - Replace side-by-side panes with modal layers (drawer/sheet patterns)
    - Use selection-heavy inputs (chips, carousels) to minimize typing
    - Implement gesture-based navigation (swipe to dismiss artifacts)
    - Optimize for touch: large targets, bottom-heavy UI, sticky controls
    - See [blazor-mobile-patterns.md](references/blazor-mobile-patterns.md)

12. **Validate protocol compliance and UX**
    - Test event serialization and SSE streaming
    - Ensure session management via ConversationId
    - Verify tool call lifecycle (queued → executing → succeeded/failed)
    - Test accessibility: focus management, `aria-live`, keyboard nav
    - Verify observability: users can see agent reasoning and state
    - Test approval workflows: non-blocking, reversible, with diff previews

### Architecture & Protocol
- **Architecture**: Use `MapAGUI` for endpoint management. Session context flows via `ConversationId` — include in all Blazor requests.
- **Transport**: AG-UI uses HTTP POST + Server-Sent Events (SSE). Blazor Server can use SignalR; ensure Blazor WASM uses SSE fallback.
- **7 Features**: Verify all 7 AG-UI features are implemented (chat, backend tools, approvals, async tools, tool-based UI, shared state, predictive updates).
- **Tools**: Define via `AIFunctionFactory.Create()`. Wrap sensitive tools with `ApprovalRequiredAIFunction`. Test JSON schema serialization.

### UX Patterns (2026 Standards)
- **Dual-Pane**: Always implement Context Pane (chat/meta) + Canvas Pane (artifact/work) separation. Don't put work products inside chat bubbles.
- **Observability**: Expose Chain of Thought. Default to collapsed but expandable. Show active tool execution. Research shows 34% reduction in "black-box anxiety" with visible reasoning.
- **HITL**: Use non-blocking approval queues, NOT blocking modals. Implement reversibility (checkpoints). Show diff previews for code/document changes. High-risk actions must require confirmation.
- **Co-Creation vs Slot Machine**: Enable persistent artifact manipulation, not just transactional Q&A. Users should edit artifacts directly, not regenerate from scratch.

### Prompting & GenUI
- **Prompting**: Use intent keywords ("Make an interactive...", "Create...") to trigger GenUI. Specify 2-4 controls per prompt for cleaner layouts. Test prompt patterns for consistent GenUI activation.
- **GenUI safety**: Default to Static GenUI for high-risk flows. If implementing declarative UI, validate against a schema and whitelist components. If embedding open-ended UI surfaces, isolate/sandbox and enforce strict origin allowlists + server-side authz.
- **GenUI Selection**: Static GenUI for enterprise apps. Declarative GenUI (A2UI/Adaptive Cards) for general-purpose. Open-ended GenUI ONLY in sandboxed playground modes.

### Technical Implementation
- **Validation**: Always sanitize HTML and validate JSON structure before rendering. Use JSON schema validation for structured outputs to ensure type-safe components.
- **Blazor**: Parse AG-UI events safely. Use DynamicComponent for tool UI rendering. Don't block SSE reads; throttle updates (100-200ms batches) to avoid render thrash. Implement graceful degradation for partial failures.
- **State Management**: Use JSON Patch (RFC 6902) for delta updates over SSE. Server is authoritative for artifact state. Consider CRDTs (Yjs/Automerge) for real-time collaboration.
- **Performance**: Stream progressively for perceived speed. Balance quality vs latency based on use case. Include only necessary context in agent calls. Virtualize long lists. Lazy-load details.

### Governance & Control
- **Approval Policies**: Define risk levels (high/medium/low) per action. High-risk: delete, production ops, large-scale changes. Auto-approve low-risk after timeout.
- **Reversibility**: Create automatic checkpoints before every agent action. Enable "undo" and "time travel" UI. Panic button stops execution AND reverts state.
- **Audit Trail**: Log all approvals/rejections with ConversationId for traceability and compliance.

### Mobile & Accessibility
- **Mobile**: Use drawer/sheet patterns instead of side-by-side panes. Bottom-heavy UI for thumb zone. Minimize typing with chips/carousels. Support gestures (swipe to dismiss).
- **Accessibility**: `aria-live` for streaming updates. `aria-expanded` for accordions. Large touch targets (44x44pt minimum). Support dark mode and reduced motion.

### Debugging
- **Traceability**: Log ConversationId with all tool invocations and approval requests.
- **Error Visibility**: Show partial results on stream failure. Provide retry mechanisms. Expose reasoning traces for debugging agent behavior

- **Architecture**: Use `MapAGUI` for endpoint management. Session context flows via `ConversationId` — include in all Blazor requests.
- **Transport**: AG-UI uses HTTP POST + Server-Sent Events (SSE). Blazor Server can use SignalR; ensure Blazor WASM uses SSE fallback.
