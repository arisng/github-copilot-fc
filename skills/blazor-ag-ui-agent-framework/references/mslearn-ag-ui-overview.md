# Microsoft Learn: AG-UI overview

## Summary
- AG-UI is a standardized protocol that connects agents to web/mobile clients with streaming, state sync, and interactive UI capabilities.
- The Agent Framework integration exposes agents over HTTP + SSE and maps Agent Framework concepts (agents, threads, tool calls) to AG-UI events.
- The docs highlight seven supported feature areas, including backend tool rendering, human-in-the-loop, generative UI, shared state, and predictive state updates.

## Key takeaways for .NET/Blazor
- Use AG-UI when you need multi-client access, real-time streaming, and protocol-level state and tool orchestration.
- The ASP.NET Core hosting package provides the integration surface and protocol adapter.
