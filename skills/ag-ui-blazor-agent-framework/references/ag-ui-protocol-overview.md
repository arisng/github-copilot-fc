# AG-UI protocol repository overview

## Summary
- AG-UI is an open, lightweight, event-based protocol that standardizes how agents connect to user-facing applications.
- The repo describes a small set of standard event types and a flexible middleware layer that works across transports like SSE, WebSockets, or webhooks.
- Feature highlights include streaming chat, shared state sync, generative UI, frontend tool integration, and human-in-the-loop workflows.
- AG-UI complements other protocols: MCP (tools) and A2A (agent-to-agent), focusing on agent-to-UI interactions.
