# CopilotKit: Generative UI overview

## Summary
- Generative UI means the agent partially or fully determines what UI appears, adapting to user intent and context.
- The docs describe three surface patterns: chat, chat+ (co-creator workspace), and chatless (embedded UI).
- It also outlines three UI types: static (prebuilt components), open-ended (arbitrary markup), and declarative (schema-based UI specs), plus tradeoffs in freedom vs. control.

## Key takeaways for AG-UI
- AG-UI and CopilotKit support the full spectrum of generative UI patterns, providing shared primitives for state, events, and interaction.
