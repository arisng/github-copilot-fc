## 🎯 Core Concept: Grounding Level (0-100%)

**Every task gets a score showing how well it's documented in planning artifacts:**

| Score | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 100% | Explicit in artifact ("Add X to Y") | ✅ Safe to execute |
| 80% | Well-documented, pattern inferred | ✅ Safe to execute |
| 60% | Documented, needs verification | ⚠️ Verify before executing |
| 40% | Inferred from multiple sources | ⚠️ High risk |
| 20% | Assumed without evidence | 🔴 Block |
| 0% | Not grounded at all | 🔴 Block |

**Decision Rule**:
- ✅ **APPROVED** if ≥90% of Phase 1 tasks ≥80% grounded
- ⚠️ **CLARIFY** if 70-90% meet threshold
- 🔴 **BLOCKED** if <70% meet threshold

---

## ⚡ The Process: 5 Steps (15-25 minutes)

```
1. Extract tasks from tasks.md
           ↓
2. Index all planning artifacts
           ↓
3. Map each task to artifact evidence
           ↓
4. Score grounding level (0-100%)
           ↓
5. Generate report + decide
           ↓
✅ APPROVED / ⚠️ CLARIFY / 🔴 BLOCKED
```
