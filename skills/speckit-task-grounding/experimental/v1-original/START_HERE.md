## ⏰ Quick Decision Path (15 minutes)

### 1. Read This (2 min)
✅ You're reading it

### 2. Read REVIEW_SUMMARY.md (10 min)
→ Understand what this is, why it matters, decide if you want it

**Get**: Overview, real example, integration timeline, your decision

### 3. Decide (3 min)

## 📚 What's In The Framework

**Core Innovation**: "Grounding Level" (0-100%)

Every task gets a score showing how well it's documented in planning artifacts:

- **100%** = Explicit ("Add X to Y file")
- **80%** = Well-documented
- **60%** = Needs verification
- **40%** = Inferred
- **20%** = Assumed
- **0%** = Not grounded

**Decision Rule**:
- ✅ Approve if ≥90% of Phase 1 tasks ≥80% grounded
- ⚠️ Clarify if 70-90%
- 🔴 Block if <70%

---

## 🎯 The Process (5 steps, 15-25 min)

```
Extract tasks
    ↓
Index artifacts
    ↓
Score each task (0-100%)
    ↓
Identify gaps & risks
